# Butternaan's Jugaad Website

The idea for this site came from [shinyzenith.xyz](https://shinyzenith.xyz/) and [emersion.fr](https://emersion.fr/). The aim is to have a fast and minimalist site with the essential links and socials; no frameworks, no builders, and minimal animations.

Thus, there is not much to say about this site. It's all plain HTML and CSS, done in the Gruvbox theme I love and deployed via Netlify (for the sake of not having to handle hosting). The blog is on [a separate repository](https://github.com/butternaandev/blog), and is built using [Zola](https://getzola.org/). It's bloody fast :P

## Contributing

This repository is meant for me to test my abilities, and improve my skills - a form of learning by doing. Thus, the repository is not open to external contribution to code. Though if any information stated is **factually incorrect**, feel free to open an issue.
